# Teams Shell

A high-fidelity static shell of the Microsoft Teams Chat UI, meant as a starting point for prototyping new Teams features. Fork this repo, drop in your idea, and you'll have a realistic-looking Teams surface from day one — so the prototyping work goes into the feature, not the chrome.

## What's inside

- **Teams chat UI** — title bar, nav rail, chat list, chat view, compose, sessions rail, agents rail
- **Realistic mock data** — contacts, conversations, agents, sessions — populated so the shell looks lived-in out of the box
- **Component-scoped styling** — each `.jsx` has a sibling `.css`, no Tailwind or CSS-in-JS
- **Design guide** — color tokens, spacing, and layout decisions in [`DESIGN_GUIDE.md`](DESIGN_GUIDE.md)
- **Reference screenshots** — [`images/`](images/) for diffing against real Teams when tuning pixel accuracy

Nothing is wired to a backend. The shell is static on purpose — prototypes stay small, fast, and easy to hand off.

## Quick start

Requires Node 20.19+ (Vite 8 requirement).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at http://localhost:5173.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |

## Prototyping a feature

1. **Set up the scenario** — edit the mock data in `src/data/` to add a chat, agent, message thread, or session that fits your feature
2. **Make the current user yours** — update `currentUser` in `src/data/contacts.js` (name, initials, avatar). The default avatar is a generic placeholder at `public/avatars/user.jpg`
3. **Build or extend a component** in `src/components/` — every component has a scoped `.css` sibling
4. **Match the visual language** — reference [`DESIGN_GUIDE.md`](DESIGN_GUIDE.md) for colors and spacing, and diff against the screenshots in `images/` when a surface needs to look indistinguishable from real Teams
5. **Ship it** — `npm run build` produces a static bundle you can host anywhere

## Stack

React 19, Vite 8. No routing, no state management library, no backend — deliberately small so the code stays easy to read and modify.
